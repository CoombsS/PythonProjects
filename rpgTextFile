You stand on the cobblestone street, facing the front enterance of the grand church. The church was triangular, and solid white obsidian. The walls were shaped like a parabula, the fragmented sun causing rays to shoot off the bright white moon-glass in every direction, painting the street in a prism of colors.
On each corner of the church stood a large, black marble tower topped with a large aparatus holding a mirror. This mirror would be rotated at night, causing the church to glow bright white-green.
